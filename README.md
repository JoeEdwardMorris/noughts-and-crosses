# noughts-and-crosses
Simple game of noughts and crosses for OS X Terminal. Written in Swift. 

Note - the 'NoughtsandCrosses' file in the root folder is an executable version that you can run in the mac terminal to try out - grid numbers are 1-9 representing the rows left to right, top to bottom... (first row 1-3, second row 4-6, thrid row 7-9)

If your mac thinks it's a text file and won't run it, enter 'chmod +x ' (with space) into the terminal and then drag the NoughtsandCrosses file onto the terminal and execute, then try running the file again (may need to change security settings to allow unknown developer in this instance).
